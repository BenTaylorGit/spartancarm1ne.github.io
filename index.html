            Hello, my name is Ben Taylor and I’m a Producer for games. I’m currently studying at the University of Central Florida and expected to graduate in the spring of 2018. Since the first time I pushed in the Pokémon Gold cartridge in my Game Boy Color, I’ve had a passion for video games. After winning a number of awards at the state and national level for game design, I realized that this is what I was meant to do. I currently want to become a producer in the games industry. I have strong work ethics, communication skills, and a collaborative mindset. I know I can succeed at guiding any team to realizing their vision.

        </P>

        <p>
            If I’m not working on a game design project, I can be found enjoying in my spare time playing some of my current favorite games such as, Destiny 2, Overwatch, or Hearthstone.
        </p>
